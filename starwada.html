<p><em>A delicate presentation of Star Wada<sup><small>TM</small></sup> on a white 
plate</em></p>
<p> Prepare your tastebud for an exciting new flavour that was co-developed me in 
collaboration with my sister. This delectible delicacy is not the the as easy as 
cooking a pack of instant noodles, but it also isn't as hard as baking a cake. If 
you've been in the kitchen for more than 15 minutes, you will know that the most 
important ingredient in the kitchen is patience. And with that ethos, let's begin 
the recipe.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>Patience</li>
<li>Chickpeas<li>
<li>Corn sttarch</li>
<li>Spices (red chilli powder, mixed herbs, etc.)</li>
<li>Lots of galric cloves, finesly chopped</li>
<li>One Onion, finely chopped</li>

</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Soak the chickpeas in water for at least 6 hours</li>
<li>Drain the chickpea water and rinse the chickpeas</li>
<li>Boil the chickpeas, preferably in a pressure cooker, or any large pot until 
the chickpeas can be easily squished between thine digits</li>
<li>Get the whole load of chickpeas, roughly dry them using a towel, and mash them 
with a masher, leaving a few chickpeas unmashed.</li>
<li>Put on some frank ocean songs</li>
<li>Add some chilli powder, salt, and spices to the chickpeas</li>
<li>Add a cup of corn starch to the chickpeas</li>
<li>Mix everything up using your hands</li>
<li>Once everything is mixed, make several patties out of the chickpea 
mixture</li>
<li>Fyr the patties in a mildly piled pan on each side until dark brown</li>
</ol>

<p>That's it, your chickpea patties, nay, your Star Wadas are done!
Slap some burger buns on that shit and add some lettuce and tomato, and you're 
good to go.</p>
