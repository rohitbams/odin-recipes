<p><em>Steaming plate of Tofu Fried Rice, garnished with toasted sesame seeds and 
peanuts</em></p>

<p>
This simple recipe is wonderfully easy to cook, and super tasty. 
Although this isn't a recipe I developed with my sister during the pandemic, it 
is a recipe I used merely hours ago to cook dinner for myself, and hence the freshest in my mind right now.
